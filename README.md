# Text Editor 
Text editor application with spell check and auto-complete features, as well as a Word Path finder and a Markov text generator for fun.

This project was one of a series of projects I completed while earning the [Object Oriented Programming in Java: Data Structures and Beyond](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented) specialization offered by the University of California - San Diego, on Coursera.

### What I learned
- Object-oriented programming in Java
- Advanced Data Structures
- Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness
- Trees (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)
- Hash Maps and Edit Distance
- Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking
